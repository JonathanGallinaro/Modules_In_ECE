**Linear Voltage Regulator:** 

What the design is?

The type of circuit used for this design is a standard setup in order to ensure that the linear regulator used will not over heat or be disruppt by noise. 
A bulk capacitor is used to keep the output voltage stable when a high demand is needed. A bypass capcitor is used to filter AC noise. This type of setup is what is called a fixed setup. 
This is because no matter want the input voltage is the resulting output voltage will be always a contant value. Disclaimer these types of regulators are not efficient. 
What is the datasheet used?


**Adjustable Voltage Linear Regulator:**

What the design is?

The type of circuit used for this design is a standard setup from the datasheet of the manufacurer. 
It consists of bulk and bypass capacitors as well as an adjustable potentiometer/rehenstat in order to vary the output voltage of the system.

**Useful Information:**

How to import the design into a new diptrace schematic?

Since I am using Altium designer I will list the steps for how to use it in DipTrace & Altium Designer. 

**DipTrace:**

Step 1: Open up schematic capture. 

Step 2: File --> Import --> DipTrace ASCII --> Click File --> Open

Step 3: File will be imported into schematic editor

**Altium Designer:**

Step 1: Open new schematic

Step 2: File --> Import --> DXF/DWG --> Click File --> Open

Step 3: File will be imported into Project.
